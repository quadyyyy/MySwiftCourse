#  Swift Course Files

This repository contains my main files, exercises and notes created while learning Swift and SwiftUI.
All code here is from courses, books, videos and personal practice.

My timeline: 

September 1, 2025 — Started the Swift course by Alex Skutarenko.

November 11, 2025 — Finished the Swift course and started a SwiftUI course by The Swift Developers, along with materials from objc.

# Notes

The structure of the repository may change over time as I reorganize files or add new materials.
Older code, drafts etc. are kept for reference.
